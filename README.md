Random Batch Scripts That I Have Written To Find IP Address Compile Some Cool Repositories

These are some free to use batch files that I have created for fun, One is to get your IPv4 address and so on, the name of the file describes what the batch script does.

Feel free to use and distribute these any way you see fit, just please credit me as these did take time to write.

Thanks!

Your's Truely,
